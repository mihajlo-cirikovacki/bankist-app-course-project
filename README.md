## Bankist app project

I created an online bank interface, where the user can log in, and has an overview of all transactions, total account balance, there is an option to transfer money to someone else, request a loan from the bank and close the account. 
This is a project from Udemy course by Janas.
The focus of this project was working with arrays, numbers and dates.
